# pydataops

Contributing to the debate of which is the best data processing library to use in Python. The ideia is to test only the default implementation of the library, no specializations implemented. Any library can be use to perform well in many tasks, this shall evaluate the performance of the library with the lowest effort necessary.

Test multiple data sizes (`Mib`, `Gib`) for multiple data operations (`join`, `groupby`, `aggregate`) over multiple data types (`string`, `integer`, `float`).
